#DESCRPTITION=The Spam Email Detection project is a practical implementation of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and unsolicited or harmful emails. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains thousands of labeled email messages. Each message is preprocessed to remove noise such as punctuation, special characters, and stopwords, followed by tokenization and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF. The cleaned text data is then fed into various classification models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

To evaluate model performance, standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed. Among the models tested, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier often performs exceptionally well due to the probabilistic nature of word distribution in spam content. The project includes data visualization components to explore word frequencies and patterns in spam vs. ham emails. Word clouds and bar plots highlight the most common terms in each category, enhancing model explainability. The application of techniques like n-grams and stemming further improves model performance.
